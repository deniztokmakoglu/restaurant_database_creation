The work split for MS3 was similar to that described in earlier sections of this project-- where all coding 
and project design was done together in the same room.

The matching algorithm relies on Jaro Winkler distance. It initially checkes the state and city of the restaurant pair and if they are
similar enough, checks the address of the restaurant to determine if they are the same restaurant. The parameter threshold for 
similarity can be changed. For this project we used 0.8

The algorithm for how we select the master record relies on comparing lenght of strings. For example if there were two linked
restaurants and one of them was "DAMN DINING" and the other "DAMEN DINING", "DAMNEN DINING" would be selected as the primiary restaurans
name as the string is longet than "DAMN DINING".
