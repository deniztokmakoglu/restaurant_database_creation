We essentially did all of the work for this MS together in the same room working on each task simulataneously. We spent
a considerable amount of time together just figuring out how making the commits to the database works and trying to make sense
of the MS in general and talking through the assignment. Once finished, we have each made solo passes through it and
attempted to clean up some of our functions we wrote.
